# steam-hours-played-graph-generator
This uses the matplot library and the steam api to form a bar graph of games and their hours played. You may have to zoom and stretch the graph to see the actual game name labels.

You may may have to install the matplotlib library and the requests library.
There are ten quintillion tutorials explaining how to do this so just search up "how to install python [library name] library" and it trouble shoot from there.

Oh yes and your steamID that is required is located in the top right dropdown on steam --> account details
